// Problem Solving:
// Problem-1: Array Filtering and Mapping
//1. Create an array of objects, each representing a person with properties like name, age, and gender. Write a function to filter out all females and then map the remaining people to an array of names. Print the final result.


// Problem-2: Object Manipulation
// Create an array of objects representing books with properties like title, author, and year. Write a function that takes the array and returns a new array with only the book titles. Print the result.


// Problem-3: Function Composition
// Write three functions: one to square a number, one to double a number, and one to add 5 to a number. Compose these functions to create a new function that squares a number, doubles the result, and then adds 5.


// Problem-4: Sorting Objects
// Create an array of objects representing cars with properties like make, model, and year. Write a function to sort the array of cars by the year of manufacture in ascending order. Print the sorted array.

// Problem-5: Find and Modify
// Write a function that searches an array of objects for a specific person by name. If found, modify their age property. Print the updated array.
